      <h2>Nutrition</h2>
      <p>
        Proper nutrition is just as important as exercise in achieving a healthy lifestyle. Eating the right balance of macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) is key to fueling your body for workouts and daily activities. Here are some general tips for healthy eating:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eat Whole Foods:</strong> Focus on nutrient-dense foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Water is essential for performance, recovery, and overall health. Aim for at least 8 cups a day.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance Your Macros:</strong> Ensure you are getting a balance of proteins, carbs, and healthy fats for sustained energy.</li>
      </ul>
